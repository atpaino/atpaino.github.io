My name is Alex Paino and I am a Senior at the University of Missouri studying 
Computer Engineering and Math. I do research into Computational Intelligence 
and am especially interested in biologiclaly inspired approaches in Artificial 
Intelligence. Some of the areas I'm most interested in are [Evolutionary 
Computation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation) (EC) and 
[graphical models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model) 
influenced by the structure of the neocortex, such as the 
[Hierarchical Temporal Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_temporal_memory) 
(HTM) model.
