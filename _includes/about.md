Hello!

My name is Alex Paino and I am a machine learning engineer at [Sift Science](http://www.siftscience.com) where I focus on building [the most accurate models possible](https://engineering.siftscience.com/large-scale-decision-forests-lessons-learned/) in support of our various abuse prevention products. Prior to joining Sift, I graduated from the University of Missouri in 2014, where I studied Computer Engineering and Mathematics and conducted [research](http://atpaino.com/research/) applying Evolutionary Computation and Computer Vision techniques to explosive hazard detection.
