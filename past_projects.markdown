Hack Mizzou 2013
================
For Hack Mizzou my team created Social Sonar, a web app that maps tweets around 
you onto a sonar-like interface. The app is available at 
<http://social-sonar.herokuapp.com>,
and the code is availalbe on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/atpaino/socialsonar), 
and was written in Python using Django.
This app won the social mapping category of the hackathon.

The Block (social networking site)
==================================
In 2011-12 I created a location-aware social networking site called the Block. 
It can be accessed at <http://www.inmyblock.com> and the code is hosted on my 
GitHub [here](http://github.com/atpaino/theblock), and was written in Python 
using Django.
