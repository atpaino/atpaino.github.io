Current Work
============
I'm currently working in the Computational Intelligence Research Lab at the 
University of Missouri. I'm working on using 
[Genetic Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming) (GP) 
to evolve image feature extraction algorithms that are an abstraction of the 
[Histogram of Oriented Gradients](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients) (HOG) 
and [Local Binary Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_binary_patterns) 
algorithms.
